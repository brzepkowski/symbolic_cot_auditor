<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
Joey and Chandler live together.
Joey bought 10 apples. He came back home and ate 3 of them.
Then Chandler came back home with 8 new apples.

The same story repeated for 7 days.

How many apples the two frineds have after seven days?
<think>

To determine the total number of apples Joey and Chandler have after seven days, I'll start by analyzing the events that occur each day.

Every day, Joey buys 10 apples and eats 3, leaving him with 7 apples. Chandler then brings 8 new apples to their home. Combining these, they have 7 + 8 = 15 apples each day.

Over the course of 7 days, this daily total accumulates. Multiplying the daily total by the number of days gives 15 apples/day * 7 days = 105 apples.

Therefore, after seven days, Joey and Chandler together have 105 apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many apples Joey and Chandler have after seven days.

### **Daily Apple Consumption**

1. **Joey's Apples:**
   - **Buys:** 10 apples
   - **Eats:** 3 apples
   - **Remaining:** 10 - 3 = **7 apples**

2. **Chandler's Apples:**
   - **Brings:** 8 apples

3. **Total Apples per Day:**
   - Joey's remaining apples + Chandler's apples = 7 + 8 = **15 apples**

### **Total Apples After 7 Days**

Since the same pattern repeats for 7 days, we can calculate the total apples by multiplying the daily total by 7.

\[
\text{Total Apples} = 15 \, \text{apples/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 105 \, \text{apples}
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{105}
