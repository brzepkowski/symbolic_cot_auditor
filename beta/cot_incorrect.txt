First, let's analyze Joey's apple consumption. Joey starts with 10 apples and eats 3 each day. This means he consumes a total of 21 apples over seven days.

Next, Chandler brings back 8 apples each day. Over seven days, Chandler contributes a total of 56 apples.

Adding these together, the friends have a combined total of 77 apples after seven days.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many apples Joey and Chandler have after seven days.

### **Day 1:**
- **Joey:**
  - Starts with 10 apples.
  - Eats 3 apples.
  - **Apples left:** 10 - 3 = **7 apples**
  
- **Chandler:**
  - Brings back 8 apples.
  - **Apples:** 8 apples

### **Total after Day 1:**
- **Apples:** 7 (Joey) + 8 (Chandler) = **15 apples**

### **Day 2 to Day 7:**
This pattern repeats for 7 days. Since the story is the same each day, we can multiply the daily total by 7.

### **Total over 7 Days:**
- **Apples per day:** 15 apples
- **Total apples over 7 days:** 15 apples/day × 7 days = **105 apples**

### **Final Answer:**
After seven days, Joey and Chandler have a combined total of \(\boxed{105}\) apples.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
